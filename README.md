# UFOs

## Overview of the project

For this project the client has requested a webpage that allows users to explore UFO sightings using a dynamic table. The table proivdes in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by giving users the ability to filter information on UFO sightings on multiple criteria. 

## Results

Interfacing with the website and dynamic table is extremely easy and straightforward. Users may enter a search criteria into any of the respective search fields and the UFO data will be displayed. For example you can use only one search criteria such as state or country as shown in the following screenshots from the website. 

### Florida Search

Additionally you can search the website data on multiple search criteria as seen in the next screenshot where a search was performed for UFO sightings on 1/1/2010 in Alaska

## Summary

The current website will provide users with a great place to begin their research or answer questions they may have regarding UFO sightings. To further enhance the user experience more UFO sighting data should be added to the current data as it only covers sightings in 2010. Also the website can be updated to allow users to enter a search in any case. Currently the form will only filter data if the search text is entered as lowercase. A search for 'CA' in the state field for example will not return any results even though the current data does contain sightings that occured in California.
